# EZMoonblow Project Rules

**Always follow the guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md`** before making any changes.

Key rules:
- Use **tabs** for indentation.
- Opening brace on same line for functions/methods/loops, new line for classes/enums/interfaces.
- All comments in **English only**.
- Use typographic quotes (“curly”) and apostrophes’ in comments. End the comments with a period.
- End files with one empty line, no closing `?>`.
- Always use **type hints** and **Money class** for monetary values.
- Use enums instead of string literals.
- Database column names must have table prefix (e.g., `task_sender`, `heartbeat_status`).
- To add a migration, run: `tasks/db/create-migration`.
- The project uses custom migration system. Don’t try to guess the syntax, always check the existing migrations.

Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for complete details.
